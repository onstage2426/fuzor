## 1.1.0 — 2026-06-11

- Empty phrase (`""`) in `search()` and `searchBoolean()` now browses all documents instead of returning nothing. Supports all `SearchOptions` (filter, sort, facets, distinct, pagination). Default order is newest-inserted first.
- Bumped `actions/checkout` and `actions/cache` in CI.
- Added release workflow that creates a GitHub Release on `v*` tag push.
